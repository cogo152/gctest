1. Error and Exception handling : print core dump, print file and line if possible
2. Handle suit commands sigaction in main thread. Stop test suit and report if interrupt comes from user.
3. Reorder test case priorities if multithreaded. Maybe barrier? How to success without shared lock?. Maybe shyncronized vector?
4. Executor is not CLEAN code.
5. Assertion messages are not CLEAN code.
6. Think Global Suit before and after test case parameters integration. Should not override user defined.
7. find better solution for target link library pthread
8. add negative test for equal(all primitive) + ptr
9. handle error start stop command
